Following assumptions were made for this lab assignment:

- A word means sequence of characters between white-spaces or EOF.
	- As a consequence, "Pal" is correct for Task3 as 'P' is in middle (between starting and ending quote).
- For Task 4: word is any sequence of characters without white-space and double quotes.
- For RegexTime.pl : 01.00 am as well as 1.00 am will be marked correct.
- In both RegexTime.pl and RegexPhone.pl : trailing spaces will be ignored.
